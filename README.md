# Welcome to My Custom Shell

This code is written in C and it is able to do anything the original shell did but you can custom it.

What I do is I created another process using fork() and in the child process I will excecute any input from the user.

By doing this, I can custom some command in which the original shell can't do.

For example, I custome the help, and Ctrl+C command.

# Usage

Run

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -g -Og -o customShell customShell.c
./customShell
```
